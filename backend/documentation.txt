//In early days js was used in frontend only as scripting language for the browser.
//In this period the javascript was not supported in the server, so python ,php, java etc were used as backend.

//Later on concept of node.js was introduced as a runtime for javascript on the server.
//Now the runtime (nodejs) is responsible for executing the javascript code on the server side.

//Node js is the runtime prototype which is complex and has a lot of features.
//Then Express js was introduced as the framework instead of core nodejs.

//API(Backend/Server)
//Application Programming Interface
//It serves as a bridge between frontend and database.


//Steps to create a backend server using expressjs:
//1. create a backend folder and go inside it 
//2. npm init -y
//3. npm i express
//4. npm i mongoose
//5. add  "type": "module", in package.json
//6. npm i nodemon --> keeps the server running (nodemon server.js)

//MongoDB
//MongoDB is NoSQL database
//It stores data in the form of documents and collection(JSON).
//Backend cannot talk to database directly, It should use mongoose to talk to the database.
